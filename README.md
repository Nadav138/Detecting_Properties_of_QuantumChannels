# Detecting_Properties_of_QuantumChannels
 Work I did during my participation in summer program by MCQST:
https://www.mcqst.de/support/summer-bachelor-program/

The main files are: QC_Detection.ipynb & QC_Detection_IBMQ.ipynb
The first is implementation using simulator and the second one actually run the code on IBMQ's machine.
Additional pdf file is available, explaining the main idea of the project.
