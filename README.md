# Detecting_Properties_of_QuantumChannels
 Work I did during my participation in summer program by MCQST:
 
https://www.mcqst.de/support/summer-bachelor-program/

The main files are: 

1. QC_Detection.ipynb
2. QC_Detection_IBMQ.ipynb
   
The first is implementation using simulator and the second one actually run the code on IBMQ's machine.

Additional pdf file is available, explaining the main idea of the project.
Dont hesitate to contact me on any matter: nadavba138@gmail.com
