# Detecting_Properties_of_QuantumChannels
 Work I did during my participation in summer program by MCQST:
 
https://www.mcqst.de/support/summer-bachelor-program/

The main files are: 

1. QC_Detection_IBMQ.ipynb
2. QC_Detection.ipynb

   
The first one is implementation that actually run the code on IBMQ's machine and the second is the preliminary code I used running on QASM simulator.

Additional pdf file is available, explaining the main idea of the project.
Dont hesitate to contact me on any matter: nadavba138@gmail.com
